<h1> Movie-Trailer-Website </h1>

Udacity Project 1: Movie Trailer Website - using Python This project will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. The code stores a list of movie titles, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. This information is displayed on a web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.

This Movie Trailer Website Project Consists of 3 Files build with Python version 2.7.9 files that store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website.

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, poster URL and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and groups all the instances together in a list.

The Python module called freshtomatoes.py has a function called openmovies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
